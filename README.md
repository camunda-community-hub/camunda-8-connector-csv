# camunda-8-connector-csv

A connector will be used to manage CSV files


# Principle


## CSV

**CSV**
A CVS is a ASCII file.
The file contains multiple line.
The first line is the definition, and each other line are records, one record per line.
The definition line contains a serie of fields separate by a separator. By default, the separator is a ";".


Example:
````
FirstName;LastName;Email;Address;City:Country
Pierre-Yves;Monnet;pierre-yves.monnet@camunda.com;833 Washington av;San Francisco;USA
Francis;Hulster;francis.hustler@cinema.fr;65 champs ElysÃ©e;Paris;France
````
 

**Multi header CSV**
A multi header CSV describe complex record, with children, as an order. An order contains the principal record (command number, address to deliver) and lines (one line per product)
A multi header CSV handle this kind of record. Each record has a type. And the header contains multiple definition, one per type.
A multi header has two first code:
* The type of the line
* how to attach the record in the data

A multi header line need to identity when the header finish and data start.


For example, this is the multi header to describe a order, with line, discount code for the line and stock location information for the line

```yaml
command:
  line:
    discount
    stock
```


The CSV is
````
ORDER;ROOT;CommandNumber;FirstName;LastName
LINE;ORDER;Productname;Quantity;UnitPrice;Netprice;price
DISCOUNT;LINE;DiscountCode;discountValue
STOCK;LINE;Location;Quantity;
-----------------------------------------------
ORDER;345;Michel;Blanc
LINE;Sink;2;354.00;312.24;624.48
DISCOUNT;GoldMember;0.10
DISCOUNT;BlackFriday;0.5
STOCK;F553;2
ORDER;346;Francis;Hustler
LINE;Chair;4;132.00;128.00;512.00
DISCOUNT;BlackFriday;0.5
STOCK;T44;3
STOCK;T45;1
LINE;Table;1;245.00;240.00;240.00
DISCOUNT;BlackFriday;0.5
STOCK;T66;1
````


## Access the file

The FileStorage library is used.


## Functions available in the connector

* get-info

Return information on the CSV: number of items, headers, multi format CSV or unique


* read

Read a CSV, and produce a list of Map. A converter can be associate (to transform a String in Integer, or a String in a java.util.date)
A page number, and number of records in the page is given to handle large CSV and protect the reader.
A multi header CSV can be manage by the reader

A filter can be added during the read, via multiple key (read only data where amount > 1000)

* write - append

Write a List of Map in a CSV. A converter can be associated, to transform a java.util.Date to a special string format.
The writer can append data in an existing CSV, and it will respect the format of the existing CSV then.

As option, it can update the CSV to add new columns

* update a CVS

Update an existing CVS with a List of Map. A converter is provided, and correlation keys (for example, the correlation key is 'firstName', 'lastname') to find the record in the existing CSV.


**Flow functions**

These functions does not provide any process variable with data, but process CSV file completely and produce a new CSV file.

* Merge

Merge two CSV files in one file. It can merge only data (assuming the first CSV is the reference) or data and header

* filter

Filter a complete CSV file to a new file.

* extract

Extract a complete CSV file to a new CSV file. Use a filter

# Build

```bash
mvn clean package
```

Two jars are produced. The jar with all dependencies can be uploaded in the [Cherry Framework](https://github.com/camunda-community-hub/zeebe-cherry-framework)

## Element Template

The element template can be found in the [element-templates](/element-templates/keycloak-function.json) directory.
